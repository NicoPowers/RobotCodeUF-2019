Below are the following steps to get setup with ROS...

1. [Install Ubuntu Linux 16.04 image (you may want to install the 64 bit image)](http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/)
2. Create a bootable image using the image you downloaded by flashing it to a thumbdrive ([I recommend this software program to flash to a thumbdrive](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)]),
   and then stick it in to your computer and restart your computer and boot into the thumbdrive and follow this installation process for the Ubuntu image.
   There are tutorials online and many YouTube videos detailing this process.
3. [Start reading this book](http://lsi.vc.ehu.es/pablogn/investig/ROS/A%20Gentle%20Introduction%20to%20ROS.pdf)
